# Occupation-matrix-control-in-VASP

Occupation matrix control sets the occupations used when calculating the DFT+U corrections. It does not directly change the electron distribution. In this way it will effectively encourage the occupations entered. This has two direct uses

1) To set a specific electronic occupation.

2) To obtain localisation at a specific site (atom and location) and look for the minimum energy occupation.
